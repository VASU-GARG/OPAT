# OPAT - One Platform For All Teachers

# What it does
Our project will allow teachers (no mater in which domain they are) who used to teach class 10th, or 12th or college students to exchange their ideas and teaching materials with each other. Teachers can register to our website and then they can download the materials uploaded by other teachers and can even upload any material, in any field which they think can be useful to other teachers. Our project mainly focus on bringing all the teachers form all over India together on one platform

# How we built it
We have as of now just built the front-end part of our website , which will give an idea what we want to implement. We have used bootstrap studio and Visual studio code to built the front-end part.

# Challenges we ran into
The first challenge we faced was to think of a perfect idea which can solve current problems in the education system. But after lots of thinking and discussion we came up with this wonderful idea which We think can improve the current education system in India. While implementing the idea we have to look at different websites to understand some terms , we even spent hours in learning some new frameworks which can make our site more attractive and beautiful. we also tried implementing the backend part of our website, but due to lack of time as well as complete skills we cannot do so.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud that we came up with an product which can solve the current position of education system In India. The fact that we kept in mind while thinking of this idea is that in today's world, there are many platforms, programs and NGO's which work on improving the education quality for students, but their is no platform which look over to help teachers , which can provide teachers an opportunity to communicate with their peers. We think our project will surely help teachers from all over India to look at what other teachers are doing in the respective fields and it will further help them to improve their teaching methods and style which will going to help students as well.

# What we learned
During this hackathon, we learnt various new things which will help us in future. The biggest thing which we learnt is , how to work as a team, how to listen to other's idea and even express your idea to them and then finally implement the combined idea together. In terms of technical skills , we learnt basics of java script languages and how to use it in our project.

# What's next for OPAT - one stop for all teachers
Our idea is not completely implemented. we have many more things in our mind which we want to involve in our product. We even want to include teachers working at levels greater than the college level to use our product.
